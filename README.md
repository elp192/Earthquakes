## Project Overview
In this project, an interactive map representing earthquakes around the world is created. The earthquakes' magnitudes and coordinates are obtained from GeoJSON data, and data is plotted on Mapbox map via an API call.

The following sources and tools are utilized:<br>
GeoJSON file:
- [Tectinic Plates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)
- [Earthquakes data related to past 7 days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson)
- [Major Earthquakes (above 4.5 mag) data related to past 7 days](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)

Languages: Javascript, HTML, and CSS

Dependencies: Leaftlet and D3.js

Software: Visual Studio Code

API: [Mapbox account](https://www.mapbox.com) is created and Mapbox API key is saved in the config.js file in /earthquakes/static/js/.
